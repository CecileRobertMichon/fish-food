    caveats = [[Be aware that Draft is currently experimental and does not have a stable release yet. We make no backwards-compatible guarantees between releases.

When upgrading, make sure to `rm -rf ~/.draft` before bootstrapping Draft according to the installation guide:

    https://github.com/Azure/draft/blob/v]] .. version .. [[/docs/install.md

If you bootstrapped an application using `draft create`, you'll also want to remove the files `draft create` generated before running `draft create && draft up` again.

Please make sure to read the release notes for further information:
